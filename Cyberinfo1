More Cyber

🔐 1. CIA Triad
The foundation of cybersecurity.
* Confidentiality – Keep data secret from unauthorized users. Example: Encryption, access controls, VPNs.
* Integrity – Ensure data is accurate and unaltered. Example: Hashing (e.g., SHA-256), file checksums.
* Availability – Make data accessible when needed. Example: Redundant systems, backups, UPS systems.

⚖️ 2. Risk Management & Incident Response
* Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
* Risk Management Steps:
    * Identify risks (e.g., asset inventory, threat modeling)
    * Assess risks (qualitative or quantitative)
    * Mitigate (apply controls), accept, transfer, or avoid
* Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST SP 800-61):
    1. Preparation
    2. Detection & Analysis
    3. Containment, Eradication, Recovery
    4. Post-incident Activity

🎭 3. Threat Actors & Attack Vectors
* Threat Actors:
    * Script kiddies – Unskilled attackers using tools
    * Hacktivists – Political or social motives
    * Nation-state actors – Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
    * Insiders – Employees or contractors
    * Criminal syndicates – Organized cybercrime
* Attack Vectors:
    * Phishing, malware, ransomware
    * Drive-by downloads
    * Physical access (e.g., USB attacks)
    * Wireless (e.g., Evil Twin AP)

🔐 4. Cryptography Basics
* Symmetric Encryption: Same key for encryption/decryption Example: AES (fast, but requires key sharing)
* Asymmetric Encryption: Public/private key pair Example: RSA, ECC (used in SSL/TLS, email signing)
* Hashing: Converts data to a fixed value; irreversible Example: SHA-256, MD5 (not secure anymore)
* PKI (Public Key Infrastructure):
    * Digital certificates
    * Certificate Authorities (CAs)
    * Supports digital signatures, HTTPS, and email encryption

🌐 5. Network Security
* Ports & Protocols:
    * HTTP: 80 / HTTPS: 443
    * FTP: 21 / SSH: 22 / DNS: 53 / RDP: 3389
    * Know which are secure/insecure
* Firewalls: Control inbound/outbound traffic using rules
* IDS/IPS: Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems IDS alerts; IPS blocks
* VPNs: Encrypt data over public networks Example: IPSec, SSL VPN

👤 6. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Authentication Factors:
    * Something you know (password)
    * Something you have (token)
    * Something you are (biometrics)
* Access Models:
    * RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
    * ABAC (Attribute-Based)
    * MAC (Mandatory)
    * DAC (Discretionary)
* Principle of Least Privilege – Only necessary access

📜 7. Regulations
* GDPR – EU data protection law (privacy by design, data subject rights)
* HIPAA – US law protecting health info
* PCI-DSS – For credit card data security
* SOX, FISMA – Financial and federal system requirements

🧱 8. Security Frameworks
* NIST (800 series): US government cybersecurity standards
    * 800-53 (controls), 800-61 (incident response)
* ISO 27001/27002: International standard for ISMS (Information Security Management Systems)
* COBIT, CIS Controls, SABSA: Other models used in industry
